# Protocols
Protocols are controls on the tardis console that function to make your playthrough easier, 
here are them layed out for you to better understand what function they serve when activated.

To locate where these controls are on the console, use the [**Sonic Screwdriver**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-02-02-sonic %})
while in scanning mode.

Hope this helps!

# Protocol 1913 (AKA **Siege Mode**)
Siege Mode is a function on your TARDIS designed to keep the pilot safe, which should only be used as a last resort when all
else fails. Siege Mode disables the TARDIS power and shrinks the exterior to a smaller and more protected version. As explained earlier
Siege Mode is designed to keep the pilot safe, and it completes this task by forcing the doors to be deadlock sealed and not allowing 
any lifeform inside or outside the TARDIS dimention. Siege Mode requires fuel to be activated, if attempted to be activated 
without the neccesary fuel it will not activate.

Siege Mode does not drain any [Artron energy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-artron-energy %}) while activated, this is because
all systems are powered down. Including **life support**. While in Siege Mode the TARDIS will become extremely cold and you will begin to
**freeze to death**, to combat this leather armour is suggested to be worn while activated. 

As mentioned earlier, the TARDIS shrinks the exterior to a smaller and more protected version, this includes shrinking it weight. The TARDIS
is now able to be picked up by any third-party who comes across it, this is why it is highly suggested to activate your TARDIS **handbrake** 
while Siege Mode is activated to prevent such an event occuring.

# Protocol 3 (AKA **Cloak Mode**)
Cloak Mode is a function on your TARDIS console designed to keep the TARDIS hidden when the chamelion circuit is faulty. Cloak Mode 
will render your TARDIS exterior invisible to the naked eye, and will reveal itself only when a pilot holding a TARDIS key linked to the console.
When a pilot, holding a key, is within 5 metres of the exterior the exterior will start to reveal itself. The closer the pilot approaches the exterior
the more the TARDIS will reveal itself.

Cloak Mode requires [Artron energy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-artron-energy %}) to operate, make sure you have a heafty supply before
you activate this emergency protocol!

# Protocol 116 (AKA **Autopilot**)
Autopilot is a function on your TARDIS console designed for when there is less then the required pilots to navigate the time vortex. This protocol allows for automated navigation throughout the time vortex, but is programmed to take the safest route possile which is not always the shortest. This protocol takes extra [Artron energy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-artron-energy %}) to operate so make sure you have enough fuel in your TARDIS before flight.

# Protocol 813 (AKA **Hail Mary**)
Hail Mary Mode is a function on your TARDIS console designed to rescue the pilot when in immediate danger of death. This protocol allows the TARDIS, when the handbrake is disabled, to rematerialise around the pilots position to rescue them from certain death.

Hail Mary Mode also requires [Artron energy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-artron-energy %}) to operate, so make sure that the TARDIS has a healthy supply of fuel before activating this protocol.
