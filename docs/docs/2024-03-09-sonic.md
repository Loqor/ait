# Sonic Screwdriver    
![Capaldi Sonic Screwdriver](../assets/mechanical.png)

The Sonic Screwdriver is a handheld device used for various tasks, these tasks range from seeing what parts of the console are linked to what controls to blowing up TNT. More explained below!

To **link** a Sonic Screwdriver to a [**Tardis Console**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-02-02-tardis-console %}) right click on the **Sonic Port** whilst holding the Sonic Screwdriver. It should of now have gone into the **Sonic Port** and have linked to the **TARDIS**, to remove it punch the Sonic Screwdriver in the **Sonic Port** and it will eject from the [**Console**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-02-02-tardis-console %})

To **charge** a Sonic Screwdriver to a [**Tardis Console**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-02-02-tardis-console %}) right click on the **Sonic Port** whilst holding the Sonic Screwdriver. Like you would for linking it then the Sonic Screwdriver should start charging (keep in mind the Sonic Screwdriver uses the [**Artron Energy**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-artron-energy %})) to charge). After when you have done charging your Sonic Screwdriver punch the Sonic Screwdriver from the **Sonic Port** and it will eject from the [**Console**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-02-02-tardis-console %})

# Crafting Recipe
The Sonic Screwdriver crafting recipe is this:

# Sonic Modes

The sonic has 5 modes, those modes are:

- Inactive (Powered Off)
- Interaction
- Overload
- Scanning
- TARDIS

**Inavtive (Powered off)** mode renders the Sonic Screwdriver unuseable, this will be used as a form of power saving mode for the Sonic Screwdriver.

**Interaction** mode allows the Sonic Screwdriver to ignite candles, campfires and unlit torches.

**Overload** mode allows the Sonic Screwdriver to ignite TNT!  If the TARDIS is actively in toxic or unstable mode (happens after crashing), if you sonic the air of the TARDIS your sonic is linked to and you're currently inside said tardis, it will repair it much, much quicker.

**Scanning** mode allows the Sonic Screwdriver to tell you what console controls are by hovering over the [**Control Entities**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-control-entities %}) and will show you the controls hitboxes. It will also confirm if you are located inside of a [**Rift Chunk**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-rift-chunk %}) and how much [**Artron Energy**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-artron-energy %}) is stored in that chunk.

**TARDIS** mode allows the Sonic Screwdriver to set the destination of the TARDIS wherever you right click, as long as its avalilable to land, and deactivates the handbrake.
If you are within 256 blocks of the TARDIS exterior, the TARDIS will be summoned to the location of choice.

# Sonic Settings & Configuration
Defaultly you would have the 2nd doctors sonic when crafting it or by getting it from the creative menu but there is a way to modify the Sonic Screwdriver casing, check it's power, see what TARDIS ID it is linked to and what casing it has.

To change it firstly right click on the **Sonic Port** whilst holding the Sonic Screwdriver, then when it's in go to the [**Monitor**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-1-31-Monitor %}) and click on **Settings** and click onto **Sonic Settings** now you will be able to view the Sonic Screwdriver's data but also the buttons for switching TARDIS Interiors & Exteriors. Pressing though them should allow you to change your Sonic Screwdriver to 4 different cases (PRIME (2nd Sonic), MECHANICAL (12th Sonic), CORAL (10th Sonic), RENAISSANCE (14th Sonic) and FOB (15th Sonic)) and clicking the button underneath the Sonic Screwdriver display should set it to that casing and punching the **Sonic Port** should give you back the Sonic Screwdriver.

# Sonic TARDIS Repair
After crashing your TARDIS, repairing it would take a while but there is an alternitive to speed up the repair process and to do this hold your Sonic Screwdriver (in any mode you want it to be) and right click the **TARDIS Exterior** the Sonic Screwdriver should be inserted into the keyhole (or nose) and start speeding up the TARDIS repair (usually the sped up repair process should take usually 25 seconds) just like the the (Doctor WHO 60th 2nd Special Episode: Wild Blue Yonder) if you right click the **TARDIS Exterior** when its repairing the Sonic Screwdriver will tell you how many seconds there is till the TARDIS repair has finished (This will not destroy your existing interior and replace it with a new one). Once the repair has finish the Sonic Screwdriver should pop out of the **TARDIS Exterior** and the TARDIS is repaired for you to use again.

# Other Info
If you don't know what block can be interacted with a Sonic Screwdriver, make sure you have the Sonic Screwdriver in you hand and if you face a block (that can be interacted with a sonic then the crosshair should look a bit like the Sonic Screwdriver) but this would apply to all of the modes so some would need to be interacted in the **Interaction** Mode or the **Overdrive** Mode the **TARDIS** Mode applys to all of the block as there is where you are summoning the TARDIS from

Once the Sonic Screwdriver runs out of charge it will be stuck on **Inactive** Mode till you have charged your Sonic Screwdriver in the **Sonic Port**
