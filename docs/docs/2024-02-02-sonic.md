The Sonic Screwdriver is a handheld device used for various tasks, these tasks range from seeing what parts of the console are linked to what controls to blowing up TNT. More explained below!

To **link** a Sonic Screwdriver to a [**Tardis Console**]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/2024-02-02-tardis-console) shift right click on the **Telepathic Circuits** whilst holding the Sonic Screwdriver.

# Sonic Modes

The sonic has 5 modes, those modes are:

- Powered Off 
- Interaction
- Overload
- Scanning
- TARDIS

**Powered off** mode renders the Sonic Screwdriver unuseable, this will be used as a form of power saving mode for the Sonic Screwdriver once the power feature has been implemented.

**Interaction** mode allows the Sonic Screwdriver to ignite candles, campfires and unlit torches.


**Overload** mode allows the Sonic Screwdriver to ignite TNT!  If the TARDIS is actively in toxic or unstable mode (happens after crashing), if you sonic the air of the TARDIS your sonic is linked to and you're currently inside said tardis, it will repair it much, much quicker.

**Scanning** mode allows the Sonic Screwdriver to tell you what console controls are by hovering over the [**Control Entities**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-control-entities %}). It will also confirm if you are located inside of a [**Rift Chunk**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-rift-chunk %}) and how much [**Artron Energy**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-artron-energy %}) is stored in that chunk.

**TARDIS** mode allows the Sonic Screwdriver to set the destination of the TARDIS wherever you right click, as long as its avalilable to land, and deactivates the handbrake.
If you are within 256 blocks of the TARDIS exterior, the TARDIS will be summoned to the location of choice.
