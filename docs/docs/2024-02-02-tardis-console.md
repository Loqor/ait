## What is a TARDIS Console?

The TARDIS console is the main control unit of the TARDIS, which can be interacted with by a player or another entity. The TARDIS should always be piloted by 6 fully-trained TARDIS pilots as to allow for a smooth journey.

Out-of-universe, the console is a collection of [**Control Entities**]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024-01-26-control-entities) which are located around the console block that do different functions.

## How do I create a console?

To create a console, craft a **Console Generator**. You are provided with one Console Generator when you configure a new desktop. Using a Console Generator is the only way to create a console. 

Here is the crafting recipe for a Console Generator:

Place the Console Generator in the TARDIS interior to select any of the unlocked consoles that exist.

To use the Console Generator, follow this easy guide:
1. Right click on the Console Generator to change the **type** of console.
2. Right click *while crouching* on the Console Generator to change the **variant**.
3. Confirm the console by using a linked [**Sonic Screwdriver**]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024-02-02-sonic).






## How do I use a TARDIS Console?
If you're having a hard time finding the controls, you can use a [**Sonic Screwdriver**]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024-02-02-sonic). Alternatively, you're able to turn on debugging mode for viewing entity **hitboxes**, using F3+B which will toggle the debug **hitbox** mode.

Right or left click on any of the controls to activate them. Certain controls - like the **throttle** - need you to crouch to increment them fully up or fully down but will do normal increments while free-standing.

The **Increment Control** is a special control, however; it goes from 1-10-100-1000, and you can also crouch to decrease down instead of increasing up the scale.

The **Coordinate System** (X, Y and Z) require you to right click to decrease the increment from the current position and require you to left click to increase the increment from the current position. 

The **Dimension Control** will change the destination dimension from one dimension to another. Right click the control to change the dimension.

The **Exterior Facing Control** will change which direction exterior faces next time you land ranging from North, East, South and West. Right click the control to change the facing clockwise.

The **Fast Return Control** will set the destination coordinates to the last location the TARDIS landed. Right click the Fast Return control to activate fast return, click it again to set the destination to your current location.

The [**Protocol Controls**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-01-TARDIS-Protocols %}) are explained in this webpage.

The **Anti-Gravity Control** will make the TARDIS exterior immune to falling, but uses [**Artron Energy**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-artron-energy %}) while activating.

The [**Waypoint Controls**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-1-31-waypoints %}) are better explained in this webpage.

The **Power Control** switches the TARDIS engines off and turns the power off, rendering most of the console non-functional. If activated while other controls are activated it will disable those controls.

The **Alarm Control** switches the TARDIS alarms from active to inactive.

The **Door Control** opens the TARDIS exterior doors when right clicked.

The **Door Lock** locks the TARDIS exterior doors, rendering them inoperable until unlocked either using a TARDIS key or using the door lock control once again.

The [**Monitor Control**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-1-31-Monitor %}) is explained more in this webpage.

The **Refuel Control** requires the handbrake to be engaged. The refuel control will take in [**Artron Energy**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-artron-energy %}) slowly when not in a [**Rift Chunk**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-rift-chunk %}), if it is in a rift chunk then it increases refuel speed.

The **Land Type Control** sets the TARDIS to try and land on the **surface** while enabled or land at the specific **destination coordinates** while disabled.

The **Randomiser Control** does exactly what is says on the tin. This control randomises the destination coordinates depending on how high the **increment control** is set.
