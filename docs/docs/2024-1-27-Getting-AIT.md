## How do I get AIT's early betas
It is highly recommended that you **do NOT** use these versions, unless you are a beta tester in the MDTeam Server.

They are likely buggy and with temporary issues and tests, which is why they are beta testers only

Use these at your own risk, there may be little help/support.

The betas can be found [on Github Releases](https://github.com/M-D-Team/ait-fabric-1.20.1/releases)

## Note - when you find any bugs / crashes, please create a [Github Issue](https://github.com/M-D-Team/ait-fabric-1.20.1/issues/new) or ask for help in the support channel in the discord.
