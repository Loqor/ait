## What Are They?
They are custom entities made for the [**TARDIS Console**]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/2024-02-02-tardis-console) to allow the player and other entities to interact with.
They are conformed to the size of the control they are intersecting, and can be shot with arrows or other projectiles to be activated.
